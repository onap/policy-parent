Feature: no locking
*******************

.. contents::
    :depth: 3

The no-locking feature allows applications to use a Lock Manager that always succeeds.  It does not deny
acquiring resource locks.

To utilize the no-locking feature, first stop policy engine, disable other locking features, and then enable it
using the "*features*" command.

In an official OOM installation, place a script with a .pre.sh suffix:

    .. code-block:: bash
       :caption: features.pre.sh
        #!/bin/sh

        sh -c "features disable distributed-locking"
        sh -c "features enable no-locking"


under the directory:

    .. code-block:: bash
        oom/kubernetes/policy/components/policy-drools-pdp/resources/configmaps


and rebuild the policy charts.

At container initialization, the distributed-locking will be disabled, and the no-locking feature will be enabled.
