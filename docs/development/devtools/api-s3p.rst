Policy API S3P Tests
####################


72 Hours Stability Test of Policy API
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Introduction
------------

The 72 hour stability test of policy API has the goal of verifying the stability of running policy design API REST service by 
ingesting a steady flow of transactions of policy design API calls in a multi-thread fashion to simulate multiple clients' behaviors. 
All the transaction flows are initiated from a test client server running JMeter for the duration of 72+ hours.

Setup Details
-------------

The stability test is performed on VMs running in Intel Wind River Lab environment.
There are 2 seperate VMs. One for running API while the other running JMeter & other necessary components, e.g. MariaDB, to simulate steady flow of transactions.
For simplicity, let's assume:

VM1 will be running JMeter, MariaDB.
VM2 will be running API REST service and visualVM.

**Install & configure visualVM**

VisualVM needs to be installed in the virtual machine having API up and running. It will be used to monitor CPU, Memory, GC for API while stability test is running.

Install visualVM

.. code-block:: bash
   
    $ sudo apt-get install visualvm
    
Run few commands to configure permissions

.. code-block:: bash
   
    $ cd /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/
    $ sudo touch visualvm.policy
    $ sudo chmod 777 visualvm.policy
      
    $ vi visualvm.policy
      
    Add the following in visualvm.policy
      
      
    grant codebase "file:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/lib/tools.jar" {
       permission java.security.AllPermission;
    };

Run following commands to start jstatd using port 1111

.. code-block:: bash
   
    $ cd /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/
    $ ./jstatd -p 1111 -J-Djava.security.policy=visualvm.policy  &
    
**Local Machine**

**Run & configure visualVM**

Run visualVM by typing

.. code-block:: bash
   
    $ jvisualvm
    
Connect to jstatd & remote policy-api JVM

    1. Right click on "Remote" in the left panel of the screen and select "Add Remote Host..."
    2. Enter the IP address of VM2 (running policy-api)
    3. Right click on IP address, select "Add JMX Connection..."
    4. Enter the VM2 IP Address (from step 2) <IP address>:9090 ( for example, 10.12.6.151:9090) and click OK.
    5. Double click on the newly added nodes under "Remote" to start monitoring CPU, Memory & GC.

Run Test
--------

**Local Machine**

Connect to lab VPN

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ sudo openvpn --config <path to lab ovpn key file>
    
SSH into JMeter VM (VM1)

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh -i <path to lab ssh key file> ubuntu@<host ip of JMeter VM>

Run JMeter test in background for 72+ hours

.. code-block:: bash
  
    $ mkdir s3p
    $ nohup ./jMeter/apache-jmeter-5.2.1/bin/jmeter.sh -n -t ~/api/testsuites/stability/src/main/resources/testplans/policy_api_stability.jmx &

(Optional) Monitor JMeter test that is running in background (anytime after re-logging into JMeter VM - VM1)

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tail -f s3p/stability.log nohup.out

Test Plan
---------

The 72+ hours stability test will be running the following steps sequentially in multi-threaded loops.
Thread number is set to 5 to simulate 5 API clients' behaviors (they can be calling the same policy CRUD API simultaneously).
Each thread creates a different version of the policy types and policies to not interfere with one another while operating simultaneously.  The point version of each entity is set to the running thread number.

Test Results Frankfurt
----------------------

PFPP ONAP Windriver lab

**Summary**

Policy API stability test plan was triggered and running for 72+ hours without any real errors occurring.  The single failure was on teardown was due to simultaneous test plans running concurrently on the lab system.

Compared to El-Alto, 10x the number of API calls were made in the 72 hour run.  However, the latency increased (most likely due to the synchronization added from 
`POLICY-2533 <https://jira.onap.org/browse/POLICY-2533>`_.
This will be addressed in the next release.

Performance Test of Policy API
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Introduction
------------

Performance test of policy-api has the goal of testing the min/avg/max processing time and rest call throughput for all the requests when the number of requests are large enough to saturate the resource and find the bottleneck. 

Setup Details
-------------

The performance test is performed on OOM-based deployment of ONAP Policy framework components in Intel Wind River Lab environment.
In addition, we use another VM with JMeter installed to generate the transactions.
The JMeter VM will be sending large number of REST requests to the policy-api component and collecting the statistics.
Policy-api component already knows how to communicate with MariaDB component if OOM-based deployment is working correctly.

Test Plan
---------

Performance test plan is the same as stability test plan above.
Only differences are, in performance test, we increase the number of threads up to 20 (simulating 20 users' behaviors at the same time) whereas reducing the test time down to 1 hour. 

Run Test
--------

Running/Triggering performance test will be the same as stability test. That is, launch JMeter pointing to corresponding *.jmx* test plan. The *API_HOST* and *API_PORT* are already set up in *.jmx*.

Test Results
------------

Test results are shown as below. Overall, the test was running smoothly and successfully. We do see some minor failed transactions, especially in POST calls which intend to write into DB simultaneously in a multi-threaded fashion . All GET calls (reading from DB) were succeeded.
