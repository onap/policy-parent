Policy API S3P Tests
####################


72 Hours Stability Test of Policy API
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Introduction
------------

The 72 hour stability test of policy API has the goal of verifying the stability of running policy design API REST service by 
ingesting a steady flow of transactions of policy design API calls in a multi-thread fashion to simulate multiple clients' behaviors. 
All the transaction flows are initiated from a test client server running JMeter for the duration of 72+ hours.

Setup Details
-------------

The stability test is performed on VMs running in Intel Wind River Lab environment.
There are 2 seperate VMs. One for running API while the other running JMeter & other necessary components, e.g. MariaDB, to simulate steady flow of transactions.
For simplicity, let's assume:

VM1 will be running JMeter, MariaDB.
VM2 will be running API REST service and visualVM.

    $ sudo apt-get install visualvm
    
Run few commands to configure permissions

.. code-block:: bash
   
    $ cd /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/

    $ vi visualvm.policy
      
    Add the following in visualvm.policy
      
      
    grant codebase "file:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/lib/tools.jar" {
       permission java.security.AllPermission;
    };

Run following commands to start jstatd using port 1111

.. code-block:: bash
   
    $ cd /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/
    $ ./jstatd -p 1111 -J-Djava.security.policy=visualvm.policy  &
    
**Local Machine**

**Run & configure visualVM**

Run visualVM by typing

.. code-block:: bash
   
    $ jvisualvm
    
Connect to jstatd & remote policy-api JVM

    1. Right click on "Remote" in the left panel of the screen and select "Add Remote Host..."
    2. Enter the IP address of VM2 (running policy-api)
    3. Right click on IP address, select "Add JMX Connection..."
    4. Enter the VM2 IP Address (from step 2) <IP address>:9090 ( for example, 10.12.6.151:9090) and click OK.
    5. Double click on the newly added nodes under "Remote" to start monitoring CPU, Memory & GC.

Performance Test of Policy API
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Introduction
------------

Performance test of policy-api has the goal of testing the min/avg/max processing time and rest call throughput for all the requests when the number of requests are large enough to saturate the resource and find the bottleneck. 

Setup Details
-------------

The performance test is performed on OOM-based deployment of ONAP Policy framework components in Intel Wind River Lab environment.
In addition, we use another VM with JMeter installed to generate the transactions.
The JMeter VM will be sending large number of REST requests to the policy-api component and collecting the statistics.
Policy-api component already knows how to communicate with MariaDB component if OOM-based deployment is working correctly.

Test Plan
---------

Performance test plan is the same as stability test plan above.
Only differences are, in performance test, we increase the number of threads up to 20 (simulating 20 users' behaviors at the same time) whereas reducing the test time down to 1 hour. 

Run Test
--------

Running/Triggering performance test will be the same as stability test. That is, launch JMeter pointing to corresponding *.jmx* test plan. The *API_HOST* and *API_PORT* are already set up in *.jmx*.

Test Results
------------

Test results are shown as below. Overall, the test was running smoothly and successfully. We do see some minor failed transactions, especially in POST calls which intend to write into DB simultaneously in a multi-threaded fashion . All GET calls (reading from DB) were succeeded.
