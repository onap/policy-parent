Policy API S3P Tests
####################


72 Hours Stability Test of Policy API
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Introduction
------------

The 72 hour stability test of policy API has the goal of verifying the stability of running policy design API REST
service by ingesting a steady flow of transactions in a multi-threaded fashion to
simulate multiple clients' behaviors.
All the transaction flows are initiated from a test client server running JMeter for the duration of 72 hours.

Setup Details
-------------

The stability test was performed on a default ONAP OOM installation in the Intel Wind River Lab environment.
JMeter was installed on a separate VM to inject the traffic defined in the
`API stability script
<https://git.onap.org/policy/api/tree/testsuites/stability/src/main/resources/testplans/policy_api_stability.jmx>`_
with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    jmeter.sh --nongui --testfile policy_api_stability.jmx --logfile result.jtl


Test Plan
---------

The 72+ hours stability test will be running the following steps sequentially
in multi-threaded loops. Thread number is set to 5 to simulate 5 API clients'
behaviors (they can be calling the same policy CRUD API simultaneously).
Each thread creates a different version of the policy types and policies to not
interfere with one another while operating simultaneously.  The point version
of each entity is set to the running thread number.

**Setup Thread (will be running only once)**

- Get policy-api Healthcheck
- Get API Counter Statistics
- Get Preloaded Policy Types

Test Results
------------

**Summary**

No errors were found during the 72 hours of the Policy API stability run.
The load was performed against a non-tweaked ONAP OOM installation.

**JMeter Results**

The following graphs shows the response time distribution.   The "Get Policy Types" API calls are the most expensive calls that
average a 10 seconds plus response time.

Performance Test of Policy API
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An specific performance test was omitted in Guilin.   The JMeter script used in the stability run injected
back to back traffic with 5 parallel threads with no pauses between requests.   Since the JMeter threads operate
in synchronous mode (waiting for a request's response before sending the next request), JMeter injection rates autoregulate
because of the backpressure imposed by the response times.   Even though the response times are high, the
"Response over Time" graph above indicates that thes remain at large constant throught the duration of the test.
This together with the absence of notorious spikes in the kubernetes node CPU utilization suggests that the API
component is not strained.   A more enlightning set of tests, would plot a range of number of jmeter threads
against increases in response times.   These tests have not been performed in this release.
