ACM System Level Dialogues
##########################
Priming The CLAMP Automation Composition Runtime Lifecycle Management uses the following system-level dialogues. These dialogues enable the CLAMP runtime capabilities described in Section 2 of TOSCA Defined Automation Compositions: Architecture and Design. Design Time dialogues will be described in future releases of the system.

    :depth: 4


1 Dialogues on Participants
===========================
1.1 Register a Participant
--------------------------

Participant Registration is performed by a Participant when it starts up.
It registers its replica ID, participant ID and the ACM Element Types it supports with the ACM runtime.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/RegisterParticipant.png

1.2 Deregister a Participant
----------------------------
Participant Deregistration is performed by a Participant when it shuts down. It deregisters its ID and type with the ACM runtime.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/DeregisterParticipant.png

1.3 Supervise Participants
--------------------------
Participant Supervision is performed periodically between participants and the ACM runtime server to ensure that registered participants are available over time.
Participants send a heartbeat Status message to the ACM runtime at a configured interval.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/SuperviseParticipantsStatusUpdate.png

Participants could send outProperties update using Status message to the ACM runtime.
When Status message contains outProperties, ACM-runtime updates the Database and triggers a sync message to all replicas.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/SuperviseParticipantsStatusOutPropertiesUpdate.png

The ACM runtime regularly checks the heartbeat reports from participants and takes action if participants time out. If a heartbeat message is not received for a participant replica in the Timeout Interval, the participant replica is marked as timed out.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/SuperviseParticipantsTimeout.png

1.4 Get Participant Information
-------------------------------
The information on participants is available over a REST endpoint.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/GetParticipantInformation.png

1.5 Order Full Participant Report
---------------------------------

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/FullParticipantReport.png

2 Dialogues on Automation Composition Types
===========================================
Commissioning dialogues are used to commission and decommission Automation Composition Types and to set the values of Common Parameters. The values of common parameters are included in the TOSCA YAML file that defines the full Automation Composition Type.

2.1 Commission or Update an Automation Composition Type
-------------------------------------------------------
Create on a POST and update on a PUT.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/CommissionUpdateAcType.png

2.2 Commission an Automation Composition Type using SDC
-------------------------------------------------------

2.3 Decommission an Automation Composition Type
-----------------------------------------------

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/DecommissionAcType.png

2.4 Prime an Automation Composition Type on Participants
--------------------------------------------------------
The Priming operation sends Automation Composition Types and common property values to participants for each Automation Composition Element Type in the Automation Composition Type.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/PrimeAcTypeOnPpnts.png

A participant should respond for each Automation Composition Element Type, thus causing the full Automation Composition Type to become primed. Note that if more than one participant can support an Automation Composition Element Type the ACM Runtime uses the participant in the first response it receives for that Automation Composition Element Type.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/PrimeAcTypeMultiplePpnts.png

The ACM Runtime updates the priming information in the database, and send sync message to all replicas.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/PrimeInfoUpdatedInDb.png

2.5 Deprime an Automation Composition Type on Participants
----------------------------------------------------------
The Depriming operation removes Automation Composition Types and common property values on participants for each Automation Composition Element Type in the Automation Composition Type.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/DeprimeOnParticipants.png

A participant should respond for each Automation Composition Element Type, thus causing the full Automation Composition Type to become deprimed.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/DeprimeElements.png

The ACM Runtime updates the priming information in the database, and send sync message to all replicas.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/UpdateDeprimeInDb.png

3.14 Update Operational State, Use State and outProperties on Automation Composition Instance
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/UpdateOperationalState.png

3.15 Failure handling in ACM
----------------------------
After any ACM operation is completed, one of the following result messages will be updated in the ACM. These result values are
updated along with the overall state of the ACM instance.

 - NO_ERROR
 - TIMEOUT
 - FAILED

The enum result values 'NO_ERROR' and 'FAILED' have to be set by the participants while reporting the CompositionState back to the runtime.

If the operation succeeds, the participant is required to update the result value with 'NO_ERROR' while reporting the composition state.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/SuccessAcmResult.png

The result value should be updated as 'FAILED' by the participants when any failures occurred.
Also in case of failures, the overall state of the composition/instance remains in any of the transitioning states (DEPLOYING, UNDEPLOYING, PRIMING, DEPRIMING, UPDATING, MIGRATING, PREPARING, REVIEWING, MIGRATION_PRECHECKING, MIGRATION_REVERTING)
with the appropriate result values updated by the participant.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/FailedAcmResult.png

Runtime marks the operation result with the value 'TIMEOUT' when the participant fails to report the message back during an ACM operation,
the operation result is then marked as 'TIMEOUT' by the ACM-R after the configured waiting limit is reached.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/TimeoutAcmResult.png

'TIMEOUT' is configurable for each operations. Prime and Deprime could be configured into the composition definition.

.. code-block:: yaml

  metadata:
    primeTimeoutMs: 200000
    deprimeTimeoutMs: 100000

All other operations for the instance could be configured into the instance element properties.

.. code-block:: yaml

    properties:
      deployTimeoutMs: 200000
      undeployTimeoutMs: 150000
      updateTimeoutMs: 200000
      migrateTimeoutMs: 200000
      deleteTimeoutMs: 100000

The following parameters are set in the application properties for the runtime to configure the default 'TIMEOUT' value in milliseconds.

.. code-block:: yaml

        runtime:
          participantParameters:
            maxStatusWaitMs: 100000  --> Denotes the maximum wait time by the runtime to receive the periodic status update from the participants
            maxOperationWaitMs: 100000  --> Denotes the maximum wait time by the runtime to receive the state change update from the participants

An ACM operation has to be completed and updated with any of the above specified result values in order to allow the user to trigger subsequent requests.
The user cannot trigger any state change events before the operation gets completed. When an operation is marked 'TIMEOUT',
the participants stop the operation and the user can trigger another state change event to the ACM.

The following flow shown and example of deployment that get stuck, and the user decide to undeploy.

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/TimeoutParticipant.png


3.16 OFF_LINE handling in ACM
-----------------------------
Runtime marks the participant state with the value 'OFF_LINE' when the participant replica fails to report the periodic heartbeat,
the participant replica state is then marked as 'OFF_LINE' by the ACM-R after the configured waiting limit is reached.
That scenario might happen when participant replica is shutdown, in that scenario all on going operations with that participant are marked 'TIMEOUT' due the missing messages back.

The user cannot trigger any state change events when all participant replicas state are 'OFF_LINE' (no one is available 'ONLINE').

.. image:: ../images/system-dialogues/OfflineAcmResult.png

When a participant replica state is marked 'OFF_LINE', it might come back ONLINE and the user can trigger state change events to the ACM.
