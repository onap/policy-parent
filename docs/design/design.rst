This document describes the design principles that should be used to write, deploy, and run policies of various types
using the Policy Framework. It explains the APIs that are available for Policy Framework users. It provides copious
examples to illustrate policy design and API usage.

1 Introduction
==============

The figure below shows the Artifacts (Blue) in the ONAP Policy Framework, the Activities (Yellow) that manipulate them,
and important components (Salmon) that interact with them. The Policy Framework is fully TOSCA compliant, and uses
TOSCA to model policies. Please see the :ref:`TOSCA Policy Primer <tosca-label>` page for an introduction to TOSCA
policy concepts.

.. image:: images/APIsInPolicyFramework.svg

TOSCA defines the concept of a *PolicyType*, the definition of a type of policy that can be applied to a service. It
also defines the concept of a *Policy*, an instance of a *PolicyType*. In the Policy Framework, we handle and manage
these TOSCA definitions and tie them to real implementations of policies that can run on PDPs.

The diagram above outlines how this is achieved. Each TOSCA *PolicyType* must have a corresponding *PolicyTypeImpl* in
the Policy Framework. The TOSCA *PolicyType* definition can be used to create a TOSCA *Policy* definition, either
directly by the Policy Framework, by CLAMP, or by some other system. Once the *Policy* artifact exists, it can be used
together with the *PolicyTypeImpl* artifact to create a *PolicyImpl* artifact. A *PolicyImpl* artifact is an executable
policy implementation that can run on a PDP.

The TOSCA *PolicyType* artifact defines the external characteristics of the policy; defining its properties, the types
of entities it acts on, and its triggers.  A *PolicyTypeImpl* artifact is an XACML, Drools, or APEX implementation of
that policy definition. *PolicyType* and *PolicyTypeImpl* artifacts may be preloaded, may be loaded manually, or may be
created using the Lifecycle API. Alternatively, *PolicyType* definitions may be loaded over the Lifecycle API for
preloaded *PolicyTypeImpl* artifacts. A TOSCA *PolicyType* artifact can be used by clients (such as CLAMP or CLI tools)
to create, parse, serialize, and/or deserialize an actual Policy.

The TOSCA *Policy* artifact is used internally by the Policy Framework, or is input by CLAMP or other systems. This
artifact specifies the values of the properties for the policy and specifies the specific entities the policy acts on.
Policy Design uses the TOSCA *Policy* artifact and the *PolicyTypeImpl* artifact to create an executable *PolicyImpl*
artifact. 

2 ONAP Policy Types
===================

Policy Type Design manages TOSCA *PolicyType* artifacts and their *PolicyTypeImpl* implementations.

A TOSCA *PolicyType* may ultimately be defined by the modeling team but for now are defined by the Policy Framework
project. Various editors and GUIs are available for creating *PolicyTypeImpl* implementations. However, systematic
integration of *PolicyTypeImpl* implementation is outside the scope of the ONAP Dublin release.

The *PolicyType* definitions and implementations listed below are preloaded and are always available for use in the
Policy Framework.

====================================== ===============================================================================

====================================== ===============================================================================

2.1 Policy Type: onap.policies.Monitoring
-----------------------------------------

This is a base Policy Type that supports Policy driven DCAE microservice components used in a Control Loops. The
implementation of this Policy Type is developed using the XACML PDP to support question/answer Policy Decisions during
runtime for the DCAE Policy Handler.

.. code-block:: yaml

          version: 1.0.0
          description: a base policy type for all policies that govern monitoring provision

The *PolicyTypeImpl* implementation of the *onap.policies.Montoring* Policy Type is generic to support definition of
TOSCA *PolicyType* artifacts in the Policy Framework using the Policy Type Design API. Therefore many TOSCA *PolicyType*
artifacts will use the same *PolicyTypeImpl* implementation with different property types and towards different targets.
This allows dynamically generated DCAE microservice component Policy Types to be created at Design Time.

DCAE microservice components can generate their own TOSCA *PolicyType* using TOSCA-Lab Control Loop guard policies in
SDC (Stretch Goal) or can do so manually. See `How to generate artefacts for SDC catalog using Tosca Lab Tool
<https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/How+to+generate+artefacts+for+SDC+catalog+using+Tosca+Lab+Tool>`__
for details on TOSCA-LAB in SDC. For Dublin, the DCAE team is defining the manual steps required to build policy models
`Onboarding steps for DCAE MS through SDC/Policy/CLAMP (Dublin)
<https://wiki.onap.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=60883710>`__.

.. note::
  For Dublin, microservice Policy Types will be preloaded into the SDC platform and be available as a Normative. The
  policy framework will preload support for those microservice Monitoring policy types.

For more examples of monitoring policy type definitions, please refer to the examples in the `ONAP policy-models gerrit
repository <https://github.com/onap/policy-models/tree/master/models-examples/src/main/resources/policytypes>`__.

2.2 Policy Type: onap.policies.controlloop.Operational
------------------------------------------------------

This policy type is used to support actor/action operational policies for control loops. There are two types of
implementations for this policy type

1. Drools implementations that supports runtime Control Loop actions taken on components such as SO/APPC/VFC/SDNC/SDNR
2. Implementations using APEX to support Control Loops.

.. note::
  For Dublin, this policy type will ONLY be used for the Policy Framework to distinguish the policy type as operational.

.. code-block:: yaml

        derived_from: tosca.policies.Root
        version: 1.0.0
        description: Operational Policy for Control Loops

Applications should use the following Content-Type when creating onap.policies.controlloop.Operational policies:
.. code-block::

  Content-Type: "application/yaml"

2.2.1 Operational Policy Type Schema for Drools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Dublin Drools will still support the Casablanca YAML definition of an Operational Policy for Control Loops.

Please use the the `YAML Operational Policy format
<https://github.com/onap/policy-models/blob/master/models-interactions/model-yaml/README-v2.0.0.md>`__.

2.2.2 Operational Policy Type Schema for APEX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The operational Policy Type schema for APEX extends the base operational Policy Type schema. This Policy Type allows
parameters specific to the APEX PDP to be specified as a TOSCA policy. See `this sample APEX policy type definition
<https://github.com/onap/integration-csit/blob/master/tests/policy/apex-pdp/data/onap.policies.controlloop.operational.Apex.json>`__.

2.3 Policy Type: onap.policies.controlloop.Guard
------------------------------------------------

This policy type is the the type definition for Control Loop guard policies for frequency limiting, blacklisting and
min/max guards to help protect runtime Control Loop Actions from doing harm to the network. This policy type is
developed using the XACML PDP to support question/answer Policy Decisions during runtime for the Drools and APEX
onap.controlloop.Operational policy type implementations.

.. code-block:: yaml
  :caption: Base Policy Type definition for onap.policies.controlloop.Guard
  :linenos:

  tosca_definitions_version: tosca_simple_yaml_1_0_0
  policy_types:
    - onap.policies.controlloop.Guard:
        derived_from: tosca.policies.Root
        version: 1.0.0
        description: Guard Policy for Control Loops Operational Policies

As with the *onap.policies.Monitoring* policy type, the *PolicyTypeImpl* implementation of the
*onap.policies.controlloop.Guard* Policy Type is generic to support definition of TOSCA *PolicyType* artifacts in the
Policy Framework using the Policy Type Design API.

.. note::
  For Dublin, only the following derived Policy Type definitions below are preloaded in the Policy Framework. However,
  the creation of policies will still support the payload from Casablanca.

Guard policy type definitions for *FrequencyLimiter*, *BlackList*, and  *MinMax* are available in the `ONAP
policy-models gerrit repository
<https://github.com/onap/policy-models/tree/master/models-examples/src/main/resources/policytypes>`__.

3 PDP Deployment and Registration with PAP
==========================================

The unit of execution and scaling in the Policy Framework is a *PolicyImpl* entity. A *PolicyImpl* entity runs on a PDP.
As is explained above, a *PolicyImpl* entity is a *PolicyTypeImpl* implementation parameterized with a TOSCA *Policy*.

.. image:: images/PolicyImplPDPSubGroup.svg

In order to achieve horizontal scalability, we group the PDPs running instances of a given *PolicyImpl* entity logically
together into a *PDPSubGroup*. The number of PDPs in a *PDPSubGroup* can then be scaled up and down using Kubernetes. In
other words, all PDPs in a subgroup run the same *PolicyImpl*, that is the same policy template implementation (in
XACML, Drools, or APEX) with the same parameters.

The figure above shows the layout of *PDPGroup* and *PDPSubGroup* entities. The figure shows examples of PDP groups for
Control Loop and Monitoring policies on the right.

The health of PDPs is monitored by the PAP in order to alert operations teams managing policy. The PAP manages the life
cycle of policies running on PDPs.

The table below shows the deployment methods in which *PolicyImpl* entities can be deployed to PDP Subgroups.

========== =========================================== ============================== ==================================

4. Policy Framework Public APIs
===============================

The Policy Framework provides the public APIs outline in the subsections below. For a full description of the APIs, see
their individual documentation linked in each subsection.

4.1 Policy Type Design API for TOSCA Policy Types
-------------------------------------------------

The full documentation for this API is available on the :ref:`Policy Life Cycle API <api-label>` page.

The purpose of this API is to support CRUD of TOSCA *PolicyType* entities. This API is provided by the
*PolicyDevelopment* component of the Policy Framework, see the :ref:`The ONAP Policy Framework Architecture
<architecture-label>` page.

The API allows applications to create, update, delete, and query *PolicyType* entities so that they become available for
use in ONAP by applications such as CLAMP. Some Policy Type entities are preloaded in the Policy Framework. The TOSCA
fields below are valid on API calls:

============ ======= ======== ========== ===============================================================================
**Field**    **GET** **POST** **DELETE** **Comment**
============ ======= ======== ========== ===============================================================================
(name)       M       M        M          The definition of the reference to the Policy Type, GET allows ranges to be
                                         specified
version      O       M        C          GET allows ranges to be specified, must be specified if more than one version
                                         of the Policy Type exists
description  R       O        N/A        Desciption of the Policy Type
derived_from R       C        N/A        Must be specified when a Policy Type is derived from another Policy Type such
                                         as in the case of derived Monitoring Policy Types
metadata     R       O        N/A        Metadata for the Policy Type
properties   R       M        N/A        This field holds the specification of the specific Policy Type in ONAP
targets      R       O        N/A        A list of node types and/or group types to which the Policy Type can be applied
triggers     R       O        N/A        Specification of policy triggers, not currently supported in ONAP
============ ======= ======== ========== ===============================================================================

.. note::
  On this and subsequent tables, use the following legend:   M-Mandatory, O-Optional, R-Read-only, C-Conditional.
  Conditional means the field is mandatory when some other field is present.

.. note::
  Preloaded policy types may only be queried over this API, modification or deletion of preloaded policy type
  implementations is disabled.

.. note::
  Policy types that are in use (referenced by defined Policies) may not be deleted.

.. note::
  The group types of targets in TOSCA are groups of TOSCA nodes, not PDP groups; the *target* concept in TOSCA is
  equivalent to the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) concept

4.2 Policy Design API
---------------------

The full documentation for this API is available on the :ref:`Policy Life Cycle API <api-label>` page.

The purpose of this API is to support CRUD of TOSCA *Policy* entities from TOSCA compliant *PolicyType* definitions.
TOSCA *Policy* entities become the parameters for *PolicyTypeImpl* entities, producing *PolicyImpl* entities that can
run on PDPs. This API is provided by the *PolicyDevelopment* component of the Policy Framework, see the :ref:`The ONAP
Policy Framework Architecture <architecture-label>` page.

This API allows applications (such as CLAMP and Integration) to create, update, delete, and query *Policy* entities. The
TOSCA fields below are valid on API calls:

=========== ======= ======== ========== ================================================================================
**Field**   **GET** **POST** **DELETE** **Comment**
=========== ======= ======== ========== ================================================================================
(name)      M       M        M          The definition of the reference to the Policy, GET allows ranges to be specified
type        O       M        O          The Policy Type of the policy, see section 3.1

properties  R       M        N/A        This field holds the specification of the specific Policy in ONAP
targets     R       O        N/A        A list of nodes and/or groups to which the Policy can be applied
=========== ======= ======== ========== ================================================================================

.. note::
  Policies that are deployed (used on deployed *PolicyImpl* entities) may not be deleted

.. note::
  This API is NOT used by DCAE for a decision on what policy the DCAE PolicyHandler should retrieve and enforce

.. note::
  The groups of targets in TOSCA are groups of TOSCA nodes, not PDP groups; the *target* concept in TOSCA is equivalent
  to the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) concept

4.3 Policy Administration API
-----------------------------

The full documentation for this API is available on the :ref:`Policy Administration Point (PAP) <pap-label>` page.

The purpose of this API is to support CRUD of PDP groups and subgroups and to support the deployment and life cycles of
*PolicyImpl* entities (TOSCA *Policy* and *PolicyTypeImpl* entities) on PDP sub groups and PDPs. This API is provided by
the *PolicyAdministration* component (PAP) of the Policy Framework, see the :ref:`The ONAP Policy Framework Architecture
<architecture-label>` page.

PDP groups and subgroups may be prefedined in the system. Predefined groups and subgroups can be modified or deleted
over this API. The policies running on predefined groups or subgroups as well as the desired instance counts and
properties can also be modified.

A PDP may be preconfigured with its PDP group, PDP subgroup, and policies. The PDP sends this information to the PAP
when it starts. If the PDP group, subgroup, or any policy is unknown to the PAP, the PAP locks the PDP in state PASSIVE.

The state of PDP groups is managed by the API. PDP groups can be in states PASSIVE, TEST, SAFE, or ACTIVE. For a full
description of PDP group states, the :ref:`The ONAP Policy Framework Architecture <architecture-label>` page.

The API supports retrieval of statistics for PDP groups, PDP subgroups, and individual PDPs. It also allows a PDP group
health check to be ordered on PDP groups and on individual PDPs.

The fields below are valid on API calls:

============================ ======= ======== ========== ===============================================================
**Field**                    **GET** **POST** **DELETE** **Comment**
============================ ======= ======== ========== ===============================================================

4.4 Policy Decision API - Getting Policy Decisions
--------------------------------------------------

Policy decisions are required by ONAP components to support the policy-driven ONAP architecture. Policy Decisions are
implemented using the XACML PDP. The calling application must provide attributes in order for the XACML PDP to return a
correct decision.

Decision API queries are implemented with a POST operation with a JSON body that specifies the filter for the policies
to be returned.

*https:{url}:{port}/decision/v1/ POST*

The table below describes the fields in the JSON payload for the decision API Call.

============= ======= ======== ==========================================================================
**Field**     **R/O** **Type** **Description**
============= ======= ======== ==========================================================================
ONAPName      R       String   Name of the ONAP Project that is making the request.
ONAPComponent O       String   Name of the ONAP Project component that is making the request.
ONAPInstance  O       String   Optional instance identification for that ONAP component.
action        R       String   The action that the ONAP component is performing on a resource.
                               "configure" → DCAE uS onap.Monitoring policy Decisions to configure uS
                               "naming"
                               "placement"
                               "guard"
============= ======= ======== ==========================================================================

These sub metadata structures are used to scope the resource the ONAP component is performing an action upon. At least
one must be specified in order for Policy to return a decision. Multiple structures may be utilized to help define a
precise scope for a decision.

================= ======= ======== ==================================================================
**Field**         **R/O** **Type** **Description**
================= ======= ======== ==================================================================
policy-type-name  O       String   The policy type name. This may be a regular expression.
policy-id         O       String   The policy id. This may be a regular expression or an exact value.
================= ======= ======== ==================================================================

This example below shows the JSON body of a query with a single policy ID.
