The Internal Policy Framework PAP-PDP API
#########################################

.. contents::
    :depth: 3

This page describes the API between the PAP and PDPs. The APIs in this section are implemented using `DMaaP
API <https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/DMaaP+API>`__ messaging. The APIs in this section are used for internal
communication in the Policy Framework. The APIs are NOT supported for use by components outside the Policy Framework and
are subject to revision and change at any time.

There are three messages on the API:

1. PDP_STATUS: PDP→PAP, used by PDPs to report to the PAP

2. PDP_UPDATE: PAP→PDP, used by the PAP to update the policies running on PDPs, triggers a PDP_STATUS message with
   the result of the PDP_UPDATE operation

3. PDP_STATE_CHANGE: PAP→PDP, used by the PAP to change the state of PDPs, triggers a PDP_STATUS message with the result
   of the PDP_STATE_CHANGE operation


The fields in the table below are valid on API calls:

=============================== ======== ======== ======== =====================================================

YAML is used for illustrative purposes in the examples in this section. JSON (application/json) is used as the content
type in the implementation of this API.

1 PAP API for PDPs
==================
The purpose of this API is for PDPs to provide heartbeat, status, health, and statistical information to Policy
Administration. There is a single *PDP_STATUS* message on this API. PDPs send this message to the PAP using the
*POLICY_PDP_PAP* DMaaP topic. The PAP listens on this topic for messages.

When a PDP starts, it commences periodic sending of *PDP_STATUS* messages on DMaaP. The PAP receives these messages and
acts in whatever manner is appropriate. *PDP_UPDATE* and *PDP_STATE_CHANGE* operations trigger a
*PDP_STATUS* message as a response.

The *PDP_STATUS* message is used for PDP heartbeat monitoring. A PDP sends a *PDP_STATUS* message with a state of
*TERMINATED* when it terminates normally. If a *PDP_STATUS* message is not received from a PDP periodically or in
response to a pdp_update or pdp-state_change message in a certain configurable time, then the PAP
assumes the PDP has failed.

A PDP may be preconfigured with its PDP group, PDP subgroup, and policies. If the PDP group, subgroup, or any policy
sent to the PAP in a *PDP_STATUS* message is unknown to the PAP, the PAP locks the PDP in state PASSIVE.

2 PDP API for PAPs
==================

The purpose of this API is for the PAP to load and update policies on PDPs and to change the state of PDPs.
The PAP sends *PDP_UPDATE* and *PDP_STATE_CHANGE* messages to PDPs using the *POLICY_PAP_PDP* DMaaP topic.
PDPs listen on this topic for messages.

The PAP can set the scope of *PDP_STATE_CHANGE* message:

-  PDP Group: If a PDP group is specified in a message, then the PDPs in that PDP group respond to the message and all
   other PDPs ignore it.

-  PDP Group and subgroup: If a PDP group and subgroup are specified in a message, then only the PDPs of that subgroup
   in the PDP group respond to the message and all other PDPs ignore it.

-  Single PDP: If the name of a PDP is specified in a message, then only that PDP responds to the message and all other
   PDPs ignore it.


2.1 PDP Update
--------------

The *PDP_UPDATE* operation allows the PAP to modify the PDP with information such as policiesToBeDeployed/Undeployed,
the interval to send heartbeats, subgroup etc.

The following examples illustrate how the operation is used.

2.2 PDP State Change
--------------------

The *PDP_STATE_CHANGE* operation allows the PAP to order state changes on PDPs in PDP groups and subgroups. The
following examples illustrate how the operation is used.
