Policy OOM Charts
*****************
The policy K8S charts are located in the `OOM repository <https://gerrit.onap.org/r/gitweb?p=oom.git;a=tree;f=kubernetes/policy;h=78576c7a0d30cb87054e9776326cdde20986e6e3;hb=refs/heads/master>`_.

Please refer to the OOM documentation on how to install and deploy ONAP.

Policy Pods
***********
To get a listing of the Policy Pods, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl get pods | grep policy

  brmsgw                     ClusterIP   10.43.77.177    <none>        9989/TCP                              5d15h   app=brmsgw,release=dev-policy

Some of these pods are shared between the legacy components and the latest framework components, while others are not.

Accessing Policy Containers
***************************
Accessing the policy docker containers is the same as for any kubernetes container. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl -n onap exec -it dev-policy-policy-xacml-pdp-584844b8cf-9zptx bash

Installing or Upgrading Policy
******************************
The assumption is you have cloned the charts from the OOM repository into a local directory.

**Step 1** Go into local copy of OOM charts

From your local copy, edit any of the values.yaml files in the policy tree to make desired changes.

**Step 2** Build the charts

.. code-block:: bash

  make policy
  make onap

**Step 3** Undeploy Policy
After undeploying policy, loop on monitoring the policy pods until they go away.

.. code-block:: bash

  helm del --purge dev-policy
  kubectl get pods -n onap

**Step 4** Delete NFS persisted data for Policy
Sudo to root if you logged in using another account such as ubuntu.

.. code-block:: bash

  rm -fr /dockerdata-nfs/dev-policy

**Step 5** Re-Deploy Policy pods
After deploying policy, loop on monitoring the policy pods until they come up.

.. code-block:: bash

  helm deploy dev-policy local/onap --namespace onap
  kubectl get pods -n onap

Restarting a faulty component
*****************************
Each policy component can be restarted independently when abnormal behavior is
observed by issuing the following command.

kubectl delete pod <policy-pod> -n onap

Exposing ports
**************
For security reasons, the ports for the policy containers are configured as ClusterIP and thus not exposed. If you find you need those ports in a development environment, then the following will expose them.

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl -n onap expose service policy-api --port=7171 --target-port=6969 --name=api-public --type=NodePort

Overriding certificate stores
*******************************
Each policy component keystore and or truststore can be overriden.   This will make sense
for an installation that decides to use its own certificates other than the AAF derived ones
that come preinstalled with the official ONAP distribution.

A custom policy-keystore should be placed at the following helm charts locations to override the default
one at component instantiation:

* **oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/drools/resources/secrets/policy-keystore** drools pdp keystore override.
* **oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-apex-pdp/resources/config/policy-keystore** apex pdp keystore override.
* **oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-api/resources/config/policy-keystore** api keystore override.
* **oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-distribution/resources/config/policy-keystore** distribution keystore override.
* **oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-pap/resources/config/policy-keystore** pap keystore override.
* **oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-xacml-pdp/resources/config/policy-keystore** xacml pdp keystore override.

In the event that the policy-truststore needs to be overriden, place it at the appropriate location below:
one at component instantiation:

* **oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/drools/resources/configmaps/policy-truststore** drools pdp truststore override.
* **oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-apex-pdp/resources/config/policy-truststore** apex pdp truststore override.
* **oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-api/resources/config/policy-truststore** api truststore override.
* **oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-distribution/resources/config/policy-truststore** distribution truststore override.
* **oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-pap/resources/config/policy-truststore** pap truststore override.
* **oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-xacml-pdp/resources/config/policy-truststore** xacml pdp truststore override.

After such changes follow the procedures in the :ref:`Installing or Upgrading Policy` section to make the changes
effective.

Additional PDP-D Customizations
*******************************

Credentials and other configuration parameters can be set as values
when deploying the policy (drools) subchart.  Please refer to
`PDP-D Default Values <https://git.onap.org/oom/tree/kubernetes/policy/charts/drools/values.yaml>`_
for the current default values.  It is strongly recommended that sensitive
information is secured appropriately before using in production.

Additional customization can be applied to the PDP-D.  Custom configuration goes under the
"resources" directory of the drools subchart (oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/drools/resources).
This requires rebuilding the policy subchart
(see section :ref:`Rebuilding and/or modifying the Policy Charts`).

Configuration is done by adding or modifying configmaps and/or secrets.
Configmaps are placed under "drools/resources/configmaps", and
secrets under "drools/resources/secrets".

Custom configuration supportes these types of files:

* **\*.conf** files to support additional environment configuration.
* **features\*.zip** to add additional custom features.
* **\*.pre.sh** scripts to be executed before starting the PDP-D process.
* **\*.post.sh** scripts to be executed after starting the PDP-D process.
* **policy-keystore** to override the PDP-D policy-keystore.
* **policy-truststore** to override the PDP-D policy-truststore.
* **aaf-cadi.keyfile** to override the PDP-D AAF key.
* **\*.properties** to override or add properties files.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

To *disable AAF*, simply override the "aaf.enabled" value when deploying the helm chart
(see the OOM installation instructions mentioned above).

To *override the PDP-D keystore or trustore*, add a suitable replacement(s) under
"drools/resources/secrets".  Modify the drools chart values.yaml with
new credentials, and follow the procedures described at
:ref:`Rebuilding and/or modifying the Policy Charts` to redeploy the chart.

To *disable https* for the DMaaP configuration topic, add a copy of
`engine.properties <https://git.onap.org/policy/drools-pdp/tree/policy-management/src/main/server/config/engine.properties>`_
with "dmaap.source.topics.PDPD-CONFIGURATION.https" set to "false", or alternatively
create a ".pre.sh" script (see above) that edits this file before the PDP-D is
started.
