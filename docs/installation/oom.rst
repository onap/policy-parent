    :depth: 2

Policy OOM Charts
*****************
The policy K8S charts are located in the `OOM repository <https://gerrit.onap.org/r/gitweb?p=oom.git;a=tree;f=kubernetes/policy;h=78576c7a0d30cb87054e9776326cdde20986e6e3;hb=refs/heads/master>`_.

Please refer to the OOM documentation on how to install and deploy ONAP.

Policy Pods
***********
To get a listing of the Policy Pods, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl get pods -n onap | grep dev-policy

  dev-policy-59684c7b9c-5gd6r                        2/2     Running            0          8m41s
  dev-policy-apex-pdp-0                              1/1     Running            0          8m41s
  dev-policy-api-56f55f59c5-nl5cg                    1/1     Running            0          8m41s
  dev-policy-distribution-54cc59b8bd-jkg5d           1/1     Running            0          8m41s
  dev-policy-mariadb-0                               1/1     Running            0          8m41s
  dev-policy-xacml-pdp-765c7d58b5-l6pr7              1/1     Running            0          8m41s

.. note::
   To get a listing of the Policy services, run this command:
   kubectl get svc -n onap | grep policy

Accessing Policy Containers
***************************
Accessing the policy docker containers is the same as for any kubernetes container. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl -n onap exec -it dev-policy-policy-xacml-pdp-584844b8cf-9zptx bash

Installing or Upgrading Policy
******************************
The assumption is you have cloned the charts from the OOM repository into a local directory.

**Step 1** Go into local copy of OOM charts

From your local copy, edit any of the values.yaml files in the policy tree to make desired changes.

**Step 2** Build the charts

.. code-block:: bash

  make policy
  make SKIP_LINT=TRUE onap

.. note::
   SKIP_LINT is only to reduce the "make" time

**Step 3** Undeploy Policy
After undeploying policy, loop on monitoring the policy pods until they go away.

.. code-block:: bash

  helm del --purge dev-policy
  kubectl get pods -n onap | grep dev-policy

**Step 4** Delete NFS persisted data for Policy

.. code-block:: bash

  rm -fr /dockerdata-nfs/dev/policy

**Step 5** Make sure there is no orphan policy database persistent volume or claim.

First, find if there is an orphan database PV or PVC with the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl get pvc -n onap | grep policy
  kubectl get pv -n onap | grep policy

If there are any orphan resources, delete them with

.. code-block:: bash

    kubectl delete pvc <orphan-policy-mariadb-resource>
    kubectl delete pv <orphan-policy-mariadb-resource>

**Step 6** Re-Deploy Policy pods

After deploying policy, loop on monitoring the policy pods until they come up.

.. code-block:: bash

  helm deploy dev-policy local/onap --namespace onap
  kubectl get pods -n onap | grep dev-policy

Restarting a faulty component
*****************************
Each policy component can be restarted independently by issuing the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    kubectl delete pod <policy-pod> -n onap

Exposing ports
**************
For security reasons, the ports for the policy containers are configured as ClusterIP and thus not exposed. If you find you need those ports in a development environment, then the following will expose them.

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl -n onap expose service policy-api --port=7171 --target-port=6969 --name=api-public --type=NodePort

Overriding certificate stores
*******************************
Policy components package default key and trust stores that support https based communication with other
AAF-enabled ONAP components.  Each store can be overridden at installation.

To override a default keystore, the new certificate store (policy-keystore) file should be placed at the
appropriate helm chart locations below:

* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/drools/resources/secrets/policy-keystore drools pdp keystore override.
* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-apex-pdp/resources/config/policy-keystore apex pdp keystore override.
* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-api/resources/config/policy-keystore api keystore override.
* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-distribution/resources/config/policy-keystore distribution keystore override.
* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-pap/resources/config/policy-keystore pap keystore override.
* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-xacml-pdp/resources/config/policy-keystore xacml pdp keystore override.

In the event that the truststore (policy-truststore) needs to be overriden as well, place it at the appropriate
location below:

* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/drools/resources/configmaps/policy-truststore drools pdp truststore override.
* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-apex-pdp/resources/config/policy-truststore apex pdp truststore override.
* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-api/resources/config/policy-truststore api truststore override.
* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-distribution/resources/config/policy-truststore distribution truststore override.
* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-pap/resources/config/policy-truststore pap truststore override.
* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/policy-xacml-pdp/resources/config/policy-truststore xacml pdp truststore override.

When the keystore passwords are changed, the corresponding component configuration ([1]_) should also change:

* oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/drools/values.yaml
* oom/kubernetes/policy-apex-pdp/resources/config/config.json
* oom/kubernetes/policy-distribution/resources/config/config.json

This procedure is applicable to an installation that requires either AAF or non-AAF derived certificates.
The reader is refered to the AAF documentation when new AAF-compliant keystores are desired:

* `AAF automated configuration and Certificates <https://docs.onap.org/projects/onap-aaf-authz/en/latest/sections/configuration/AAF_4.1_config.html#typical-onap-entity-info-in-aaf>`_.
* `AAF Certificate Management for Dummies <https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/AAF+Certificate+Management+for+Dummies>`_.
* `Instructional Videos <https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Instructional+Videos>`_.

After these changes, follow the procedures in the :ref:`Installing or Upgrading Policy` section to make usage of
the new stores effective.

Additional PDP-D Customizations
*******************************

Credentials and other configuration parameters can be set as values
when deploying the policy (drools) subchart.  Please refer to
`PDP-D Default Values <https://git.onap.org/oom/tree/kubernetes/policy/components/policy-drools-pdp/values.yaml>`_
for the current default values.  It is strongly recommended that sensitive
information is secured appropriately before using in production.

Additional customization can be applied to the PDP-D.  Custom configuration goes under the
"resources" directory of the drools subchart (oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/drools/resources).
This requires rebuilding the policy subchart
(see section :ref:`Installing or Upgrading Policy`).

Configuration is done by adding or modifying configmaps and/or secrets.
Configmaps are placed under "drools/resources/configmaps", and
secrets under "drools/resources/secrets".

Custom configuration supportes these types of files:

* **\*.conf** files to support additional environment configuration.
* **features\*.zip** to add additional custom features.
* **\*.pre.sh** scripts to be executed before starting the PDP-D process.
* **\*.post.sh** scripts to be executed after starting the PDP-D process.
* **policy-keystore** to override the PDP-D policy-keystore.
* **policy-truststore** to override the PDP-D policy-truststore.
* **aaf-cadi.keyfile** to override the PDP-D AAF key.
* **\*.properties** to override or add properties files.
* **\*.xml** to override or add xml configuration files.
* **\*.json** to override json configuration files.
* **\*settings.xml** to override maven repositories configuration .

Examples
^^^^^^^^

To *disable AAF*, simply override the "aaf.enabled" value when deploying the helm chart
(see the OOM installation instructions mentioned above).

To *override the PDP-D keystore or trustore*, add a suitable replacement(s) under
"drools/resources/secrets".  Modify the drools chart values.yaml with
new credentials, and follow the procedures described at
:ref:`Installing or Upgrading Policy` to redeploy the chart.

To *disable https* for the DMaaP configuration topic, add a copy of
`engine.properties <https://git.onap.org/policy/drools-pdp/tree/policy-management/src/main/server/config/engine.properties>`_
with "dmaap.source.topics.PDPD-CONFIGURATION.https" set to "false", or alternatively
create a ".pre.sh" script (see above) that edits this file before the PDP-D is
started.

To use *noop topics* for standalone testing, add a "noop.pre.sh" script under
oom/kubernetes/policy/charts/drools/resources/configmaps/:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    sed -i "s/^dmaap/noop/g" $POLICY_HOME/config/*.properties


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [1] There is a limitation that store passwords are not configurable for policy-api, policy-pap, and policy-xacml-pdp.
